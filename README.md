NOTE: project put on halt because I didn't think about if cases evaluating truthyness, which a userdata will always pass. (so you can't get all paths of execution)

used to pause & resume from multiple points within a non-virtualized function, using metatables & a custom environment.
(also contains associated project for dumping a prototype without string.dump)
